        "reason": "Direct industry fit (Software & Services) and an almost exact revenue match ($10M target vs $10M actual) with EBITDA reasonably close (3.4M vs 2.5M target); low customer concentration also reduces client-risk."

        "score": 0.185,
        "reason": "Strong market-size alignment (914.4 vs 1000 target) and service-oriented business model; revenue/EBITDA are smaller scale in the data provided, but market opportunity and service fit support selection."

        "reason": "High absolute revenue and EBITDA (165M / 22.6M) yield a weaker numeric similarity to the mid-market target, but customer concentration (35%) and strong profitability contribute to a modest overall match."
